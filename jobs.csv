 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

  

**About The Role**
 In January 2024, Notion launched Notion Calendar, introducing the second app in the Notion suite. The launch was a massive success, and we’re now looking to grow the team. We’re looking for a Software Engineer to join our small but mighty team to build the next-generation calendar. If you’re interested in building innovative, AI-powered products that create the magic of “1 + 1 = 3”, and showcase the best of using Calendar and Notion together, please let us know!
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
 We're looking for an experienced individual contributor who enjoys working alongside other experienced engineers and designers to iterate and build across the entire stack. Our team owns the Notion Calendar product end-to-end from perfecting pixels to scaling the database, so the ideal candidate is comfortable as a generalist full-stack engineer who brings expertise to one or more parts of the stack: frontend architecture, data model & API design, scaling infrastructure, etc.
   

  

* Build and co-own the core, user-facing product. You'll build the product and everything behind the scenes from the ground up, having a direct impact by shipping to users daily. You'll have autonomy and ownership because we are all individual contributors (including managers). You'll be involved in shaping the roadmap and owning the execution of it.
* Use modern web tech and influence the stack. We use React on the frontend, Node & Express on the backend, and TypeScript across the stack to build a best-in-class client and infrastructure that scales. You’ll get to make critical choices and lay the foundations.
* Create a robust and scalable backend. Architect data models, optimize database queries, and build performant REST APIs, 1st party Notion integrations, 3rd party integrations, product analytics, transactional emails, service observability, and more.
* Prototype new AI capabilities. You’ll work with Notion AI engineers to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into our product.
* Solve interesting technical problems. Bring your full creativity to solve challenging technical problems: from complex backend architecture with 1st and 3rd party integrations, real-time collaboration, syncing app state, to nifty client-side interactions.


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
 You're an individual contributor who has built such robust systems and products at scale before. We don't require formal qualifications but do value learning—especially from one another. We are looking for someone who feels a sense of duty to the users of their work.
   

  

* You have 5+ years of engineering experience and have built impressive products.
* Demonstrated ability to execute with excellence: You have thrived in fast-paced environments, tackling complex technical challenges with exceptional skill and precision. You’ve built robust software running at scale.
* Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
* Curious and quick learning: We don't expect you to have experience in every technology we use, but to learn and be productive quickly. Owning several repos and jumping into all of them doesn't scare you.
* Design sensibility: While you'll co-craft the interface with top designers and frontend engineers, we expect you to have a knack for great UX, such that you feel if something is off and can flag it, or better yet, polish it.
* Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
* Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.


**Nice To Haves**
* You’re interested in productivity apps. You might use your calendar to time block, try out Chrome extensions, configure custom app launchers, or optimize your time in other ways.
* You've built or maintained apps using React, React Native, Electron or other frameworks.
* You have experience or interest in DevOps and the infrastructure side of building great software products.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
